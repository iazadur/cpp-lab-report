This C++ code demonstrates the concept of inheritance and access specifiers (private, protected, and public) in a hierarchy of classes. 

1. Class `A` serves as the base class with private, protected, and public members.
2. Class `B` is derived from `A` with private inheritance. It can access the members of `A` privately, and its member function `accessBaseMembers` demonstrates this access.
3. Class `C` is derived from `A` with protected inheritance. It can access the members of `A` as protected, and its member function `accessBaseMembers` showcases this access.
4. Class `D` is derived from `A` with public inheritance. It can access the members of `A` as public, and its member function `accessBaseMembers` demonstrates this access.

In the `main` function, objects of classes `B`, `C`, and `D` are created, and their respective member functions are invoked:

- `b.accessBaseMembers();`: Calls the member function of class `B`, demonstrating access to the private and protected members of `A`.
- `c.accessBaseMembers();`: Results in a compilation error since `C` inherits privately from `A`, making the members inaccessible outside the class.
- `d.accessBaseMembers();`: Calls the member function of class `D`, demonstrating access to the public members of `A`.

This example illustrates how the choice of access specifiers in inheritance influences the visibility and accessibility of base class members in the derived classes.
