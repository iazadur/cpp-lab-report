This C++ program defines a class named Triangle to calculate and print the area and perimeter of a triangle. The class has private member variables `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the sides of the triangle. 

The public member functions include:
- A constructor to initialize the sides
- `perimeter()` to calculate and print the perimeter
- `area()` to calculate and print the area

In the `main()` function, an instance of the Triangle class is created with sides 3, 4, and 5. The `perimeter()` and `area()` functions are then called on this instance, displaying the calculated perimeter and area of the triangle.

The output of the program, based on the provided sides, would be:


## Output

```
Perimeter of triangle is: 12
Area of triangle is: 6
```
